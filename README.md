This a mini-project, applying Principal Component Analysis to explore if internet 'Buzz' variables are significant predictors of Box-Office Collections of Movies. The data is obtained from Versaci(2009). boxOffice.csv contains this data involving 62 movies (all wide- released movies between November 7, 2008 and April 3, 2009); the variables available (along with their descriptions) are in the table below. We will conduct the analysis ignoring the “buzz” variables (addict, cmngsoon, fandango, and cntwait3) first.
